          <h1>Password Security - Bcrypt - Even we can't see your passwords</h1>
          <p>
            Bcrypt is a widely used cryptographic algorithm specifically
            designed for secure password hashing. It is designed to be
            computationally expensive and slow, intentionally slowing down the
            hashing process to make it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
            Bcrypt incorporates a salt, which is a randomly generated value
            unique to each password, to prevent the use of precomputed hash
            tables, or rainbow tables, for password cracking. Additionally,
            bcrypt allows for easy scalability by providing a work factor that
            can be adjusted to increase the computational cost of hashing as
            computing power advances. Overall, bcrypt provides a robust and
            efficient method for securely storing and verifying passwords,
            enhancing the overall security of systems that employ it.

          <p>
            MERN stack applications utilize these technologies together to build
            full-stack JavaScript applications. Here are a few key aspects of
            MERN stack applications: Full-Stack JavaScript: MERN stack allows
            developers to use JavaScript for both the frontend (React.js) and
            backend (Node.js) development, providing a consistent programming
            language throughout the application. Single Page Applications (SPA):
            React.js enables the creation of single-page applications where the
            content is dynamically loaded, providing a smooth and interactive
            user experience. RESTful APIs: Express.js, combined with Node.js,
            allows developers to build RESTful APIs for communication between
            the frontend and backend, enabling data retrieval and manipulation.
            Scalability and Performance: The MERN stack supports scalability by
            leveraging Node.js's event-driven architecture and MongoDB's
            flexibility for handling large amounts of data. Flexibility: With
            MongoDB's NoSQL structure, developers have the freedom to evolve and
            modify the data schema without strict constraints.
